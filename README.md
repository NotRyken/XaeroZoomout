# Xaero Zoomout

Xaero Zoomout is a simple Minecraft Fabric mod that reduces the minimum zoom of 
Xaero's World Map from 0.0625x to 0.0025x

This makes it more suitable for long-distance exploration and usage on servers
with large world borders.

## Usage

No settings, no setup; just zoom out and watch it work.

As a guide, Xaero's World Map display is typically about 30k blocks wide when
fully zoomed out. With this mod, the display width is increased to about 760k.

## Performance

Rendering the world map is quite CPU-intensive, so you'll probably experience 
some lag when fully zoomed out.
